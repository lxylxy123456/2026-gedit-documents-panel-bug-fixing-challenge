 .
 If the non-architecture-prefixed versions of the gi-compile-repository,
 gi-decompile-typelib and gi-inspect-typelib tools are required, please
 install the libglib2.0-dev package, but consider using the
 architecture-prefixed versions in the girepository-tools package instead.

 C library used by projects such as GTK, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains developer-oriented command-line tools for working
 with GObject-Introspection typelibs and GIR XML, which are used to
 provide language bindings and documentation for GLib-based libraries:

  * ${local:DEB-HOST-GNU-TYPE}-gi-decompile-typelib
  * ${local:DEB-HOST-GNU-TYPE}-gi-inspect-typelib
 .
 When used via this package, these tools must be invoked with their
 host-architecture-specific names.
 .
 For command-line compatibility with non-Debian-based GLib packaging,
 the libglib2.0-dev package also provides versions of these tools for the
 system's primary architecture, named without the architecture prefix.
