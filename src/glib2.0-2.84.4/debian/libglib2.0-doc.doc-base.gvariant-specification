Title: GVariant Specification 1.0
Author: Allison Karlitskaya
Abstract:
 GVariant is a variant datatype with a data model similar to D-Bus,
 heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialized form. It works
 particularly well with data located in memory-mapped files. It can
 perform nearly all deserialization operations in a small constant time,
 usually touching only a single memory page. Serialized GVariant data
 can also be sent over the network.
